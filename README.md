# CIFAR10
Project Overview:
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes represent real-world objects: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The objective of this project is to classify these images into their respective categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Key Objectives:
Image Preprocessing: Prepare the CIFAR-10 dataset by normalizing pixel values and splitting it into training and test sets.
Model Design: Build and train a deep learning model (CNN) to classify the images with high accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and loss on both training and test datasets.
Optimization: Tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
Dataset Description:
Total Images: 60,000 images
Training Set: 50,000 images
Test Set: 10,000 images
Image Dimensions: 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)
Number of Classes: 10 (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
